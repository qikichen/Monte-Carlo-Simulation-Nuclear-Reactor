# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Nuclear-Reactor

Together with one partner I have worked on modelling a nuclear reactor and figuring out the optimal composition of fuel and moderator to find the a k-factor that would be suitable for a reactor.

The simulation uses Monte Carlo methods, probability theory and statistical methods. A written report was handed in to the supervisor as well as a presentation regarding the results.
